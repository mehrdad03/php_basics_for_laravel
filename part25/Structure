Sessions:

Session in PHP is a way to store
information (in variables) to be used across multiple pages. Unlike cookies,
sessions are stored on the server.When a session is started,
PHP creates a unique identifier for that session (a session ID),
which is stored on the client side as a cookie or passed in the URL.


Usage:

- Sore sensitive information securely on the server.
- Maintain user state and data across multiple pages.
- Typically used for login systems, shopping carts,
and other data that needs to persist between page loads.

Cookies:

Cookie in PHP is a small file that the server embeds on the user's computer.
 Each time the same computer requests a page with a browser,
 will send the cookie too. Cookies can be used to remember information about the
 user and their preferences.

 Usage:

 Store user preferences and settings.
 Track user behavior and sessions.
 Remember login credentials (with caution for security).
